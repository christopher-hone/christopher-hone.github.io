## Chris' website

I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Sydney, under supervision of Geordie Williamson. Interested in geometric representation theory, algebraic geometry, and the representation theory of finite groups.

To contact me, please use christopher.t.hone(at)gmail.com, especially if you want to know why a six functorial diagram commutes!

Geordie and I ran a modular rep theory course Semester 1 2023. The website can be be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/modular-representation-theory/home), as can recordings and notes for most lectures.
 
Papers:

[Geometric extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11780), joint with Geordie Williamson.

My [Honours thesis](./thesis.pdf). It covers some aspects of one dimensional algebraic geometry.

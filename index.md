## Chris' Website

I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Sydney, under supervision of Geordie Williamson. Interested in geometric representation theory, algberaic geometry, and the representation theory of finite groups.

Geordie and I ran a modular rep theory course Semester 1 2023.

Here is a link to my Honours thesis [my thesis](./thesis.pdf). It covers some aspects of one dimensional algebraic geometry.

Here are the lecture notes for some rep theory lectures I gave at ANU a few years back:

[Semisimple algebras](./Semisimple algebras.pdf)

[Understanding RepG](./Understanding Rep G.pdf)

[Functors between representation categories](./Functors on RepG.pdf)

[First few examples](./Examples1.pdf)

[Heisenberg group example](./Examples2.pdf)

Here is the assignment:

Here is a link to [my thesis](./thesis.pdf). It covers some aspects of one dimensional algebraic geometry. It takes the scheme theoretic perspective, and most of the time we aren't over a field, so as to be applicable to number theory/isolate the algebra-geometric aspects from the arithmetic aspects.

I also gave a colloquium style talk on the Riemann Roch theorem, proving it using the adele ring. Here is a link to [my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V86WYcHT9xQ). 

Here are the lecture notes for the rep theory lectures:

## Chris' website

I am a recent PhD graduate of the University of Sydney, under supervision of Geordie Williamson, and will be starting a postdoc at the University of Copenhagen at the end of 2025. I'm interested in geometric representation theory, algebraic geometry, and the representation theory of finite groups.

Geordie and I ran a modular rep theory course Semester 1 2023. The website can be be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/modular-representation-theory/home), as can recordings and notes for most lectures.

Papers and written work:

[Geometric extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11780), joint with Geordie Williamson.

My PhD [thesis](./PhDThesist.pdf). The first two chapters deal with geometric extensions and some applications of these objects, while the third proves a coherence theorem for six functorial commutative diagrams, introducing diagrammatics to clarify these kinds of problems.

My [Honours thesis](./Honoursthesis.pdf). It covers some aspects of one dimensional algebraic geometry.
